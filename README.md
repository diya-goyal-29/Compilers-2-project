# fns

A procedural programming language to ease financial calculations. It has inbuilt functions to calculate simple interest, compound interest, SIP and step-up SIP maturity returns. The goal is to do complicated calculations in the backend so that the user has an exact value for the amount of money involved in the picture.

####                            Required Installations

We have used flex for lexical analysis and used bison for the parser in syntax analysis.
These are the commands for the installations that are required:   
• $ sudo apt-get install flex   (Flex installation)       
• $ sudo apt-get install bison  (Bison installation)        


####                           Commands For Compiling and Running The Program
Comands for compiling and running the test cases:     
• $ make all      
• $ make ti   (for testi.fns, where i = 1,2,3)      
• $ make ei   (for errori.fns, where i = 1,2,3,4)       

Here, testi.fns are test cases with no errors and errori.fns are test cases with few semantic errors.
